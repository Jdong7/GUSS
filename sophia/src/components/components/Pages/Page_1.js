        Sofia was bored. She and her brother, Michael, were at the doctor's office, again. Sofia had asthma (said like az-muh). This is a condition that can make it hard to breathe. Sometimes Sofia would wheeze, cough, and her chest would feel tight. Wheezing means there is a whistling sound when she would breathe. She had to go for check-ups a lot to make sure she had the right medicine to help her lungs work. She was tired of going to the doctor's.
