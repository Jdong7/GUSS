        Participant: A person that agrees to be in a study. 
Placebo: A pretend medicine with nothing in it that is used to help find out if a new medicine works. Doctors and scientists use it to make sure that if a patient starts to feel better it is because of the medicine and not because of something else. 
Research: The way a scientist finds out the answers to questions. Research can be observing, experimenting, or even just reading about what other people have done. It helps us find better ways to do things like treat illnesses. 
Research Study: A lot like a science experiment. We start with a question that we want to answer, like what happens when we combine vinegar and baking soda. Then we carefully try it out. We watch and listen to what happens and we write it down. Then we have an answer to our question! 
Sample: A sample can mean a small amount of something. It can also mean a group of people chosen from a larger group of people to be part of a study. A researcher may say they want to take a sample of your blood. This means they would take a very small amount out with a needle in order to study it under a microscope. 
Science Experiment: Anything that you do to help you answer a question. This may involve using your eyes, your ears, your nose, and your sense of touch to learn about something. It involves careful planning. It also involves writing everything down. This helps the scientists remember everything that happens.
