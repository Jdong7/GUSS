          Sofia's dad had some questions for Dr. Q too. “Are there different
          kinds of research?” he asked. “Yep! There are many types of research!”
          Dr. Q said, “Sometimes we ask people to take a survey. This means you
          answer questions on a piece of paper or a computer about yourself.
          Other times we ask people to try doing something new or different to
          see if it makes them feel better. This may mean taking a different
          medicine or eating different foods, or many other types of things.
          Scientists or researchers may watch people and take notes. This is
          called observation. They also might read what people write on a
          survey. This helps them learn about the people in their study.
          Scientists might ask you to take some notes about what you are doing
          each week that you are in a study. All of this information is called
          data.”
