          Sofia was bored. She and her brother, Michael, were at the doctor's
          office, again. Sofia had asthma (said like az-muh). This is a
          condition that can make it hard to breathe. Sometimes Sofia would
          wheeze, cough, and her chest would feel tight. Wheezing means there is
          a whistling sound when she would breathe. She had to go for check-ups
          a lot to make sure she had the right medicine to help her lungs work.
          She was tired of going to the doctor's.
