        Dr. Q said “Don't worry Sofia. We want to make sure the study works for you. Please tell us if the study has too many visits to the doctor's office. Tell us if the visits are at bad times for you. We will work with you to see what is best for you!" 
Dr. Q also said, “We can give you copies of a book we made to help your friends understand what you're helping us with. It's about a sister and brother who help with research studies. They become the Research Rangers who help solve problems and improve kids' health all over the world!" 
Sofia was feeling a lot better. Sofia's dad did too. He said, “Your mom is going to want to hear all about this too, Sofia! Maybe we can bring the book home today and you can tell her all about it."
