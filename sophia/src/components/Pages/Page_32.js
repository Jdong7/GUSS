          Scientist or Researcher: A person who tries to find answers to
          questions and solve problems. They do this through observations and
          experiments. Survey: A set of questions on paper or on a computer,
          tablet or phone that you answer to help with a study. Treatment:
          Something a doctor might give you or ask you to do in order to make
          you feel better when you're sick. It can be a certain kind of exercise
          or a kind of medicine or even a new kind of food. Wheezing: A
          whistling noise that the lungs make when it is hard to breathe. This
          happens because the tubes in the lungs are too narrow. Wheezing can be
          a symptom of asthma, but it can also be because of other things.
