          “Answering questions is my job!" Dr. Q said. “My job is to connect all
          of the dots to make sure you see the whole picture. If you decide to
          help with a study, my job is to make sure that you are feeling okay
          while you're helping. It's up to you to decide if you want to help us.
          You have a chance to help other kids, and who knows, maybe even change
          the world!" "What do you think? Would you like to participate in my
          study?” Dr. Q asked Sofia and her dad. Sofia said, “I think I would
          like to do that! I want to help change the world!”
